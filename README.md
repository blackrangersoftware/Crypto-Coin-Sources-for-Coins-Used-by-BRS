# Crypto-Coin-Sources-for-Coins-Used-by-BRS
Crypto Coin Sources Used by BRS

Start of list listing page of the coin sources we use and often support the networks related.

This is a work just begining as we head towards providing attribution by the most obvious means we can. Re-sharing the code.

That stated, in many cases we also have miners, proxies, pools, and and exchange in progress of being developed and rolled out that also relate to and support these networks.

We are by no means claiming code and/or any rights other than shared with us and all license artifacts are precisely where they were placed by those who developed the software, as can be evidensed by the sometime long list of contributors to packages that we've only recently begin to host the code for.

All code updates come directly from the upstream developer and in every case that we still can, we have linked our code to the master that we cloned from so that we will always be able to receive and share code updates that have been shared froma wide ranging down stream of code ranglers, like us.

I am also just learning how this page works so here goes the first commit.
